    ]

    #Test

    # --- Task ---
    # Your task is to loop through the mission_commands, parse each one,
    # and then call the appropriate function from the imported subsystem scripts.
    # You will need to manage the state of the spacecraft (e.g., its velocity,
    # power level, temperature) as the mission progresses.

    # Example for the first command:
    # 1. Parse "EPS:CMD04:28" using your parse_command function.
    # 2. The result should tell you to do something with the EPS.
    # 3. Call a function (you might need to write a new one in eps_script.py)
    #    that handles the VOLTAGE_SETPOINT command.

    # YOUR CODE HERE
    # Loop through mission_commands and execute them
